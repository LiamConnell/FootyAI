# Soccer AI - Design Document v1

## Overview
Soccer AI is a reinforcement learning environment and system designed to train AI agents to learn cooperative behaviors in a simulated soccer game. The system provides a complete framework for training, testing, and visualizing AI agents playing soccer.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Simulation Layer**
   - Built using OpenAI Gym interface
   - Functional core implemented with Pydantic for type safety and validation
   - Handles game state, physics, and agent interactions
   - Pure functions for deterministic simulation

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Comprehensive test suite using pytest
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for game mechanics
   - Property-based testing for simulation correctness

3. **Visualization Layer**
   - Renders game state as MP4 videos
   - Supports real-time visualization during training
   - Configurable rendering options
   - Frame-by-frame game replay capability

### Technical Stack

## Implementation Details

### Game State
- Represented as immutable Pydantic models
- Includes:
  - N players per team
  - Player positions and velocities
  - Ball position and velocity
  - Game score
  - Time remaining

### Observation Space
- For each agent:
  - Positions of all N players on their team
  - Positions of all N players on the opposing team
  - Position of the ball
- All positions are in 2D coordinates (x, y)
- Total observation size: (2N + 1) × 2 coordinates

### Action Space
- For each player on the team:
  - Velocity vector (vx, vy) with magnitude ≤ v_max_player
  - Optional "kick" action when player has possession
    - Ball velocity vector (vx, vy) with magnitude ≤ v_max_ball
    - Only available when player is within d_possession distance of ball
- Total action size: N × 2 velocity vectors + optional kick actions

### Physics Parameters
- v_max_player: Maximum player velocity
- v_max_ball: Maximum ball velocity
- d_possession: Maximum distance for ball possession

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Distributed training support
   - Multi-agent coordination
   - Parallel simulation

2. **Extensions**
   - Custom game rules
   - Additional visualization options
   - Alternative physics models
   - New agent types

3. **Performance**
   - Optimized simulation
   - GPU acceleration
   - Memory-efficient state representation
   - Fast rendering pipeline

# V2 Development and Experimentation
<!-- more -->

Recall that at the end of V1, I had concluded with three [areas for improvement](./v1.md#conclusions-and-next-steps):
* Policy network improvements
* Training algorithm improvements
* End-to-end tensorization 

The training loop of V1 wasn't terribly slow, but I knew that scaling it up in its current form with either a more powerful policy network or training algorithm would put a significant drag on development. End-to-end tensorization, i.e., the expression of all simulation environment and training algorithms as tensors, would solve this with a major speedup. I decided to start with this with the hope of unlocking a step change in training speed.

> This is something that I wouldnt normally take on in a side project. Tensorization isn't rocket science, but it requires a sustained level of moderately high mental effort. It would be like signing up for 3 hours of voluntary math homework. This is a case where having AI code assist absolutely helped me achieve something that I wouldn't have taken on at all. All the cutting edge AI models were more than capable of converting the environment, and I was freed up to operate as a tech lead -- thinking of useful utilities that would help build an effective testing harness and visualization compatibility.
